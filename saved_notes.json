        "content": "7. Motion in Two Dimensions (Projectile Motion)\nProjectile motion is the motion of an object thrown into the air, subject to gravity.\n\nThe path is a parabola.\nThe horizontal motion is uniform (constant velocity).\nThe vertical motion is uniformly accelerated (due to gravity).\n8. Solved Examples and Previous Year Questions\nPracticing solved examples and previous year questions helps understand the application of these concepts. For instance, solving a projectile motion problem involves breaking it into horizontal and vertical components and applying the equations of motion."
