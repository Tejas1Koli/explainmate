            "Example for Context",
            "Imagine two neighbors, India and China, disagreeing over the exact boundary of their shared backyard (the Himalayan regions). Despite talks, one neighbor (China) suddenly takes over a part of the yard they claim is theirs (Aksai Chin) and briefly enters another disputed area (Arunachal Pradesh) before leaving, stating the dispute is settled by their actions. This simplistic analogy captures the essence of the territorial dispute and the sudden, decisive military action of the Indo-China War."
